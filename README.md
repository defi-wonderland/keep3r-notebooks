### Notebooks utils

- `fetch(abi, address)`: gets contract at address
- `deploy(abi, parameters)`: deploys contract
- `addViewTrace(contract, viewName, viewArgument, traceName)`: registers a view result to be recorded
- `addEventTrace(contract, eventName, timestampIndexArgument)`: registers an event log to be recorded
- **TODO**: `addScriptTrace()`
- `sleep(time)`: advances time
- `sleepAndRecord(timeToSleep, recordEvery)`: advances time and records traces
- `sleepAndExecute(timeToSleep, recordEvery, [{run, every}])`: advances time and records traces while executing a function

### Keep3r utils

- `keep3r.v2`: release candidate of Keep3rV2
- `keep3r.v1`: used for ERC20 implementation
- `keep3r.helper`: implementation of `Keep3rHelper`
- `keep3r.pool`: implementation of `UniV3PairManager` that tokenizes a `UniswapV3` KP3R/WETH 1% fee liquidity position
